#IT Security Analysis Project
This repository showcases a practical security assessment project focused on identifying vulnerabilities, documenting findings, and proposing security improvements. It includes structured analysis, reports, and supporting screenshots.

#Problem Context
The objective of this project was to evaluate the security posture of a publicly hosted endpoint:
Target: http://www.itsecgames.com/

#Goals of the Assessment:
Perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan
Identify misconfigurations, outdated software, and known CVEs
Assess SSL/TLS configuration and certificate status
Detect exposed information (e.g., server headers, banners, error messages)
Provide prioritized findings with mitigation recommendations

#Tools & Environment Used
The following tools and platforms were utilized during the security analysis:
Kali Linux (Virtual Machine Environment)
Nmap – Network scanning and service detection
Nikto – Web vulnerability scanning
OpenSSL – SSL/TLS inspection
WhatWeb / Wappalyzer – Technology and header fingerprinting
